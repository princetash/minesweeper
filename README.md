## Introduction

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game where the player's objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

This project aims to recreate the Minesweeper game in Python, offering an interactive graphical interface where players can enjoy the classic gameplay experience.

## Features

- Classic Minesweeper gameplay with customizable grid size and mine density.
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter library for user-friendly gameplay.
- Left-click to reveal cells and right-click to mark potential mine locations.
